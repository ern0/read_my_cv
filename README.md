# Read My CV

## The problem

- Recruiters are calibrated for one page long CVs
- As a generalist with 35 years of experience my CV is 17 pages long

## The solution (final)

- Recruiters should read CVs carefully
- They should also know the difference between C++ and C#
- They should have at least some basic knowledge about software developement
- Job search sites should handle special characters and separate C, C++ and C# result items

## The solution (actual)

Prepare CV generator:
- Write a full CV with everything included
- Tag sections and fields, e.g. "#web" or "#embedded"
- Convert it to a single-page webapp

Generate a customized CV:
- Launch the webapp
- Select tags to show or hide to make a filtered CV
- Copy CLI command and execute it to generate a PDF
- Send the custom CV to the recruiter

__TODO__ - _Check `launch.sh`_
